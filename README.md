# ConvexCoverage
The data and MATLAB code for the convex decomposition are provided here.

In this work, we provide both convex decomposition methods, coded by InnerDecompositionROI.m and OuterDecompositionROI.m, respectively.

To show how to use, please see comparison.m

These codes have been tested on MATLAB 2017b with windows 7 operating system.
